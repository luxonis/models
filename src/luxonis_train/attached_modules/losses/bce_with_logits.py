class BCEWithLogitsLoss(BaseLoss[Tensor, Tensor]):
    r"""This loss combines a `Sigmoid` layer and the `BCELoss` in one single class. This
    version is more numerically stable than using a plain `Sigmoid` followed by a
    `BCELoss` as, by combining the operations into one layer, we take advantage of the
    log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_n \left[ y_n \cdot \log \sigma(x_n)
        + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_n)) \right],

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets `t[i]` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    It's possible to trade off recall and precision by adding weights to positive examples.
    In the case of multi-label classification the loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell_c(x, y) = L_c = \{l_{1,c},\dots,l_{N,c}\}^\top, \quad
        l_{n,c} = - w_{n,c} \left[ p_c y_{n,c} \cdot \log \sigma(x_{n,c})
        + (1 - y_{n,c}) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_{n,c})) \right],

    where :math:`c` is the class number (:math:`c > 1` for multi-label binary classification,
    :math:`c = 1` for single-label binary classification),
    :math:`n` is the number of the sample in the batch and
    :math:`p_c` is the weight of the positive answer for the class :math:`c`.

    :math:`p_c > 1` increases the recall, :math:`p_c < 1` increases the precision.

    For example, if a dataset contains 100 positive and 300 negative examples of a single class,
    then `pos_weight` for the class should be equal to :math:`\frac{300}{100}=3`.
    The loss would act as if the dataset contains :math:`3\times 100=300` positive examples.

    Examples::

        >>> target = torch.ones([10, 64], dtype=torch.float32)  # 64 classes, batch size = 10
        >>> output = torch.full([10, 64], 1.5)  # A prediction (logit)
        >>> pos_weight = torch.ones([64])  # All weights are equal to 1
        >>> criterion = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=pos_weight)
        >>> criterion(output, target)  # -log(sigmoid(1.5))
        tensor(0.20...)

    Args:
        weight (list[float], optional): a manual rescaling weight given to the loss
            of each batch element. If given, it has to be a list of length `nbatch`.
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        pos_weight (Tensor, optional): a weight of positive examples to be broadcasted with target.
            Must be a tensor with equal size along the class dimension to the number of classes.
            Pay close attention to PyTorch's broadcasting semantics in order to achieve the desired
            operations. For a target of size [B, C, H, W] (where B is batch size) pos_weight of
            size [B, C, H, W] will apply different pos_weights to each element of the batch or
            [C, H, W] the same pos_weights across the batch. To apply the same positive weight
            along all spacial dimensions for a 2D multi-class target [C, H, W] use: [C, 1, 1].
            Default: ``None``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`, where :math:`*` means any number of dimensions.
        - Target: :math:`(*)`, same shape as the input.
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(*)`, same
          shape as input.
